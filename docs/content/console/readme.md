# KubeStellar Console

**Your clusters, your way - AI that learns how you work**

![Main Dashboard](images/main-dashboard.png)

## What is it?

KubeStellar Console is like a smart control room for all your Kubernetes clusters. Think of it as a dashboard that:

- Shows you everything happening across all your clusters in one place
- Learns what you care about and shows you that first
- Helps you fix problems using AI (like having a helpful assistant)
- Lets you report bugs and request features that get fixed automatically

## Why is it special?

This is one of the first projects where **AI helps maintain itself**. When you report a bug or request a feature:

1. You describe what you want
2. AI reviews it and creates a fix
3. You get a preview to test
4. Once approved, it goes into the next release

It's a closed-loop system - your feedback directly improves the product!

## Quick Numbers

## How to Get Started

### Try the Preview (No Installation)

See it running at [kubestellarconsole.netlify.app](https://kubestellarconsole.netlify.app)

### Run Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kubestellar/console.git
cd console

# Start everything
./dev.sh
```

Open http://localhost:5174 and sign in with GitHub.

> **Note**: You'll need kubestellar-mcp plugins installed. See [Installation](installation.md) for the full setup with all 6 components.

### Run in Kubernetes

```bash
# Create secrets
# NOTE: Do not put real secrets directly in commands or commit them to git.
# Prefer environment variables or a secrets file (e.g. --from-env-file) that is not version-controlled.
kubectl create namespace ksc
kubectl create secret generic ksc-secrets \
  --namespace ksc \
  --from-literal=github-client-id="$GITHUB_CLIENT_ID" \
  --from-literal=github-client-secret="$GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"

# Install with Helm
helm install ksc oci://ghcr.io/kubestellar/charts/console \
  --namespace ksc \
  --set github.existingSecret=ksc-secrets
```

## It's Safe

- **You control your data** - Uses your kubeconfig, so you only see what you have access to
- **Works for teams** - Multiple people can use the same console without seeing each other's stuff
- **No interference** - What you do doesn't affect other users
