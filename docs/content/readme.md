> **KubeStellar** is a CNCF sandbox project that simplifies the deployment and configuration of applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters, providing a seamless single-cluster experience with the tools you already know.

## Overview

KubeStellar enables you to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters as easily as managing one. Whether you're expanding from a single cluster or streamlining an existing multi-cluster setup, KubeStellar lets you define binding policies that automatically deploy and configure workloads across your fleet.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Declarative Multi-Cluster** | Define what to deploy and where using familiar Kubernetes objects and binding policies |
| **Single-Cluster Experience** | Use your existing tools (kubectl, Helm, ArgoCD) without modification |
| **Flexible Targeting** | Deploy to clusters based on labels, location, capabilities, or custom criteria |
| **Edge-Ready** | Support for disconnected environments and intermittent connectivity |
| **Status Aggregation** | Unified view of workload status across all clusters |
| **GitOps Compatible** | Native integration with ArgoCD and other GitOps tools |

## Why Multi-Cluster?

Organizations adopt multi-cluster architectures for:

- **Environment separation** - Development, staging, and production isolation
- **Team isolation** - Dedicated clusters for different groups or departments
- **Compliance** - Meeting security and data governance requirements
- **Resilience** - High availability across regions and clouds
- **Edge computing** - Running workloads close to users or data sources

## Quick Start
